The RXTE ASM Gamma-ray Data Tools (GDT) is a toolkit for RXTE ASM data built on the 
:external:ref:`GDT Core Package<gdt-core>` and builds upon the 
`Fermi GBM Data Tools <https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/gbm/gbm_data_tools/gdt-docs>`_. 

The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) was launched on December 30, 1995 and contains
three intruments. The all-sky monitor (ASM) for which this softare has been developed, consisted of
three scanning shadow cameras with proportional counters for a total collecting area of 90 sq cm.
Each camera had a 6x90 deg field of view. The ASM covered the 2-10 keV energy range and viewed 80%
of the sky every 90 minutes. RXTE also contained two pointed instruments, the Proportional Counter
Array (PCA, 2-60 keV) and the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE, 15-250 keV), which are
not incldued in the current version of this software package. RXTE was decommissioned on Jan 5,
2012.

If you use the RXTE ASM Gamma-ray Data Tools in your research and publications, 
we would definitely appreciate an appropriate acknowledgment and citation! We 
suggest the following BibTex:

.. rubric:: Additional Resources
 
The RXTE Guest Observer Facility is a fantastic resource for all things RXTE.
Specifically, for the two pointed instruments (PCA and HEXTE), detailed analysis steps can 
be found `here <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xhp_proc_analysis.html>`_.  For RXTE ASM,
light curves for monitored sources and documentation can be found here  
`MIT ASM pages <http://xte.mit.edu>`_.

.. rubric:: Acknowledgments

The Fermi Gamma-ray Data Tools were partially funded by the Fermi Guest Investigator 
program (NNH18ZDA001N) and by Cooperative Agreement 80MSFC17M0022.
